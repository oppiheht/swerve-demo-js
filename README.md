# swerve-demo-js
A simple WASD and arrow key controlled demo to see what driving a swerve drive robot is like. 

The html file is a standalone file, and the .js file is not required to run. 

The easiest way to run the demo is to view the raw html file, 'save as' to your computer, and open the file in your browser by double clicking.
